        <p>I live in Utah and I love living here! There is so much to explore outdoors, the mountains are so beautiful
            and I
            love hiking them in the summer. When winter comes around is snows and that's when it's time to go and ski
            the slopes.
            It's like a whole new world up there in the winter and it is so pretty!
