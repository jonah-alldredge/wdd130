        <p>This is me! I am currently serving a service mission and am enjoying every
            part of it! I have about 6 months left. I live in Riverton, Utah, and am
            excited to get started with school and get an education. I love to ski, and have
            been doing that since I was about 3. I love cycling, climbing, hiking, and just being
            outside in God's world! I also love to play video games and have a passion for that. I am
            so grateful for God and I see Him in my everyday life. I love going to the temple and here
            are a few of my favorites!

        <p>I live in Utah and I love living here! There is so much to explore outdoors, the mountains are so beautiful
            and I
            love hiking them in the summer. When winter comes around is snows and that's when it's time to go and ski
            the slopes.
            It's like a whole new world up there in the winter and it is so pretty!
